## Profile

Computer Science engineer building **intelligent, scalable, and structured systems** grounded in strong fundamentals.

My work centres around:

* algorithmic problem solving
* artificial intelligence systems
* system design & backend architecture
* performance-aware engineering

I focus on building fewer systems — but building them well, with clarity and depth.

GitHub serves as a structured record of my growth in **computer science, AI, and system design**.
