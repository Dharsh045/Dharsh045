## About

I am a Computer Science engineer who enjoys building structured systems rooted in strong fundamentals.
My interest lies in algorithmic thinking, intelligent systems, and designing technology that solves real-world problems with clarity and efficiency.

I prefer depth over volume — building fewer systems, but ensuring they are well-designed, scalable, and meaningful.

GitHub for me is not a storage space, but a record of growth as an engineer.
